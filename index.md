From Trincakes:

Hi Fjorseti!

Thanks for being our friend and chatting with us online these past few years (I admittedly cannot remember for how long). You've brightened a lot of gloomy days for me, and I'm sure Dante would say the same.

Even though we've never called or seen each other, your tweets have so much character that I feel like we've become close already üëç please keep being kind, witty and fun. have a great birthday!

p.s. a greater part of the gift's cost was borne by Dante so all credit to him oleaseee

From Dante:

Hey Fjor!

It's been a pleasure interacting with you on Twitter all this time. And of course, I can't thank you enough for being there to talk when I need you. I hope you enjoy your new coffee machine and game! You deserve them!

\- Dante
